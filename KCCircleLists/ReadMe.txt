KCCircleLists.vcxproj
	This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
	It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
	information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
	Application Wizard.

KCCircleLists.vcxproj.filters
	This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
	It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
	and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
	similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
	"Source Files" filter).

	This is a header file for the KCCircleLists module. It contains function declarations
	and classes for making circular linked lists.
